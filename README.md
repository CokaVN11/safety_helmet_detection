# safety_helmet_detection

## Introduction
This project is a safety helmet detection system based on YOLOv10. The system can detect whether the workers in the image are wearing safety helmets. If the workers are not wearing safety helmets, the system will mark the workers with red bounding boxes. The system can be used in construction sites, factories, and other places where safety helmets are required.

This project is instructed in the course "AI All in One 2024".
